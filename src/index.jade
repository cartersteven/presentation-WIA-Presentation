        h2  How easy is it?
        h3  I am using it right now!
        p There is a complicated setup, but the code is extremely easy to use once it is done.

      section
        h2  Setup
        h3  First, install Node.js on your machine if you do not already have it.
        p Node.js is a JavaScript environment that runs locally in your machine. It is entirely configured and used in the Terminal.
        p You can find it at nodejs.org


      section
        h2  Setup
        h3  Download the source for the automatic Bespoke Builder
        p Find it at github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoke
        p Truth be told, I am not entirely sure this was a necessary step, as Node will asynchronously pull files for you, but I did it anyway just to be sure.

      section
        h2  Warning!
        h3  I had an issue with Node's ability to actually write files to my computer at this point. my computer had not actually given it permission to write anything.
